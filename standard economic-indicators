The standard economic indicators of a sub-division (such as a region, province, state, or district) within a country typically include a mix of the following:

    Gross Domestic Product (GDP): The total value of all goods and services produced within the sub-division's boundaries over a specific period. GDP per capita provides insight into the economic well-being of individuals within the area.

    Gross Regional Product (GRP): Similar to GDP but focuses specifically on the economic output of a region rather than the entire country.

    Employment Rate: The percentage of the working-age population that is employed within the sub-division.

    Unemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is actively seeking employment but unable to find work.

    Labor Force Participation Rate: The percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment.

    Income Levels: Median household income, average wages, or income distribution within the sub-division.

    Poverty Rate: The percentage of the population living below the poverty line within the sub-division.

    Consumer Price Index (CPI): A measure of the average change in prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services within the sub-division.

    Cost of Living Index: An index that measures the relative cost of living expenses, including housing, transportation, food, and healthcare, within the sub-division compared to a base location.

    Economic Growth Rate: The rate at which the sub-division's economy is expanding or contracting over time.

    Business and Investment Climate: Indicators such as business registrations, new investment inflows, and ease of doing business rankings.

    Infrastructure Development: Investments in transportation, communication, energy, and other critical infrastructure within the sub-division.

    Trade and Export Data: The value and volume of exports and imports flowing through the sub-division's ports or borders.

    Education and Human Capital: Indicators such as literacy rates, educational attainment levels, and access to quality education and healthcare services.

    Environmental Sustainability: Measures of environmental quality, including air and water pollution levels, natural resource depletion, and efforts towards conservation and sustainability.

These indicators provide insights into the economic health, development progress, and quality of life within a specific sub-division of a country, aiding policymakers, businesses, and researchers in making informed decisions and assessments.
